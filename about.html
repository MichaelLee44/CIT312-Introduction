            <p> I believe this class is required for my major of software development. Regardless of requirement, I've enjoyed all ot my web-programming classes thus far for the content of the assignments and what we've learned. It's in line with what I like to do on my own time.</p>
            <ul>
                Goals for this class:
                <li>Finish with a grade of B- or higher</li>
                <li>Do coursework that is worthy of adding to a Portfolio/Resume</li>
                <li>Enjoy the class.</li>
