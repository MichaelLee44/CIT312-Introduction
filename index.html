I've taken 3 other classes taught by you: CIT 120, 212, and 215 (I believe) so it is a pleasure to be learning again. Right now I work at the Indiana Pacers Bikeshare as a mechanic on electric and mechanical bikes alike, but I also program and write mods for video games in my free time.</p></div></img>
